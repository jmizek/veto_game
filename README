A simulation of a novel card game. A full description of the card game is
yet to come. I aspire to make this game internet enabled eventually.

Right now the game contains a working variation on blackjack as well as a new
 game called LowBall.
 
The object of LowBall is to have the most cards without the total exceeding
 30. In the event that multiple players have the same number of cards, _then_
 the totals are compared, with the lowest total winning. If there is still a
 tie, then the tying players all win.
